# Atmosphere
Atmosphere is a private, self-service cloud computing platform that supports research efforts in the plant sciences
community.  It addresses the growing need for customized computational resources and provides the community with
access to:
  
  1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), accessible through a web portal or by API
  2. Platform as a Service (PaaS), for developing and deploying software to the scientific community
  3. Software as a Service (SaaS), with preconfigured, frequently used analysis routines, algorithms, and
  datasets designed to accommodate computationally and data-intensive bioinformatics tasks.

# Group Images -updated-
Images are snapshots of an instance at some point in time, including all programs and files.  They can be used to create
 a clone of an instance for others to use, or simply to save the state of an instance as a backup or recovery.

## Image [/images/{id}]
A single Image object.

Each Image has the following properties:

- **id**: unique id of the image
- **icon**: (optional) if a custom display icon has been uploaded for this image, this field will contain the relative
 path to that image (e.g. "/images/icon.png")
- **created_by**: username of the person who created the image
- **name**: name of the image
- **tags**: tags applied to the image (an array of strings).
- **description**: description of the image
- **start_date**: the date the image was created
- **end_date**: Atmosphere implements soft deletes for everything (or nearly everything).  Any images with an
 end_date before the moment the request was made will be filtered out of the result set.  however, end_dates can also be
 used to schedule resources deletion by setting them at a future date.  This can also be used to give someone access to
 a resource for a limited time (such as for a workshop session).
- **private**: if this field is true, it means the access to the image is limited to a group of people that includes you
- **versions**: represents all the previous versions of this image, which
  includes the current version.  It also shows which cloud providers that image version is available for.

+ Parameters
    + id (required, string, `bdc31c14-f807-11e3-8ef5-b2227cce2b54`) ... String `uuid` of the Image.

# Group Profile -updated-
The Profile contains information about the authenticated user. Profile can be thought of as the 'entry-point' to the
 Atmosphere APIs. Once authenticated, a user can find their default provider and identity. The IDs for provider and
 Identity can be used to navigate the rest of the API.

## Profile [/profile]
A single Profile object.

Each Profile has the following properties:

- **id**: the id for the user this profile belongs to
- **username**: the username of the user this profile belongs to
- **email**: the users email address
- **is_staff**: true if the user is iPlant staff
- **is_superuser**: true if the user is a super user (comes with special privileges)
- **send_emails**: true if the user wants to be notified via email when instances they've launched are ready
- **icon_set**: the style of icons the user would like to see in the Atmosphere UI when no there is no custom icon to
 display

# Group Identity -updated-
Identities are like user account information. A user has at least one identity per provider, and each identity
 contains information about how many resources can be consumed on that provider.  If a user has multiple identities
 under a single provider, it means they can allocate more resources by using a different identity.

## Identity [/identity/{id}]
A single Identity object.

Each Identity has the following properties:

- **id**: id of the Identity
- **provider_id**: the id of the provider this identity is for
- **quota**: object describing the resources that can be allocated on the provider under this identity
- **quota.mem**: the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated across all instances under this identity
- **quota.storage**: the maximum storage space that can be allocated across all volumes under this identity
- **quota.cpu**: the number of CPUs that can be allocated across all instance under this identity
- **quota.storage_count**: the maximum number of volumes that can be created under this identity

# Group Instances -updated-
Instances are virtual machines that users have created from an image (application).  When a user creates an instance
 it immediately starts deducting AU's from their account.

## Instance [/instances/{id}]
A single Instance object.

Each Instance has the following properties:

- **id**: id
- **name**: name of the instance
- **start_date**: the date the instance was created
- **created_by**: username for the person who created the instance
- **status**: the state the instance is in (active, suspended, shutoff, etc.)
- **tags**: instance specific tags (array of strings)
- **size**: the size of the instance (number of CPUs, RAM, and Disk Space)
- **provider**: the provider the instance is on
- **identity**: which account the instance deducts AU's from
- **image_version**: The specific version of an image the instance was created from
- **ip_address**: IP address you can use to connect to the machine.  Address that start with 196, 178, or 10 are private,
 all others are public.  Instances with an IP address of 0.0.0.0 have not been assigned an IP address yet.
- **has_shell**: true if a user can ssh into the instance
- **has_vnc**: true if a user can remote desktop into the instance
    
+ Parameters
    + id (required, string, '26f0795e-f80b-11e3-8ef5-b2227cce2b54') ... String `id` of the Instance.

# Group Project -updated-
Projects are a way for users to group related resources.  Right now users can add Instances and Volumes to a group, but
 we also plan to support adding documents, hyperlinks, Images, and letting users control access to their
 Projects (i.e. adding users, removing users, and specifying permissions such as read-only access or modifying content)
